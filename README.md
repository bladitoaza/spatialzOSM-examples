[SpatialzOSM](https://github.com/bladitoaza/spatialzosm) is a Python tool to generate locations, especially for activity- and agent-based models. 
Home locations are can be sampled across an area, along the road network and within building shapes. Other lcoations are extracted from OSM using [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx).

This guide contains a tutorial as a Jupyter notebook. The notebook is available in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gboeing/osmnx-examples/main?urlpath=lab) where it can be tried online.

More examples coming soon!
